# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

The client was a company called DriverPass who was wanting to create a way for people to learn how to drive.
They wanted the system to have the ability to be accessed over the internet with the abiilty for the customers to 
schedule and in person training and behind the wheel lessons with instructors. The system also needed to allow the 
admin to turn packages being offered on and off.

I feel like I transferred the information into various charts really well. Doing the sequence diagram for the purchase
pretty fun and fullfilling too.

I would probably revises my business requirements document. I feel like it may not have fully gotten all the different details.
The main design I would want to go back and change is probably the Gantt chart as I didn't realize how customizable it was until afterwards.

After reading over the transcripts of the interview I wrote down which things were the most important for the clients and made sure that those 
were addressed. After that it became about how to implement their needs with both the overall design and with the more abstract like security.
It's important to include the client's needs as they are the ones requesting and paying for the system. This also will cut down with needing to 
rework the system and allows for a faster delivery of the product.

While I'm still new to designing software my understanding is reading the list of requirements and overall design idea for the system 
then figure out how to implement all of the clients needs while still designing with integrity. Building the diagrams is a great tool as it allows 
for the general ideas to be expanded upon without actually getting into the nitty gritty of actually programming it. The diagrams can also help 
with seeing things you may not have thought of or even considered until you designed them out.
